                 <p class="text1-new text-white">XaiPient’s mission is to make AI transparent and easy to understand by offering ways to inspect the “whys” behind AI systems’ decisions. A big problem of machine models today is that they are good at predicting certain outcomes with a high degree of accuracy, but fail at explaining how they arrive at those outcomes (a problem known as black-box). As more aspects of the world are automated by AI, knowing how AI models operate is crucial to prevent accidents andbiases when deploying these systems in the wild.<p>

             <div class="col-6 pl-5 pr-5">
                 <h2 class="title3-new">Approach</h2>
                 <p class="text2-new">I joined the founding team for 4 months to help them turn years of technical research into a tangible product. I helped the product team make sense of the fast-growing space of interpretability (XAI) by mapping out different competitors, investigating potential new technologies, and identifying relevant issues regarding the design of explanations in different applications, for different users, and domains. I also produced prototypes after gathering insights from users and validating hypotheses about the value proposition of certain features and aspects of the product.</p>

                 <h2 class="title3-new">Problem</h2>
                 <p class="text2-new">The biggest design challenge I faced was: how do we build human-friendly explanations that let users understand what influenced a machine decision without relying on technical concepts and complex data visualizations? Additionally, how do we communicate decisions effectively for different levels of literacy and use cases? Since machine learning is based on probability, how do we communicate uncertainty without influencing user behavior? And finally, how do we prevent explanations from being misunderstood, creating serious risks and consequences for those affected by these very systems?</p>

                 <h2 class="title3-new">Acheivements</h2>
                 <p class="text2-new">After validating different hypotheses and having gained a wider understanding of different use cases, I shifted my focus towards ideating on solutions. I prioritized thinking in components and design patterns. I then worked on low fidelity prototypes to validate the concepts that had more traction with the team to test them in the contexts they were designed for before moving on to designing the grid, color system, data-centric elements and typography. I handed off the project before conducting user tests and iterating on concepts based on user feedback.</p>

                 <p class="text2-new">Since AI effects so many aspects of society today, I knew it was essential to include different voices and perspectives beyond the ones found in the team. Thinking about the problem through a computational and information design lens has only solved part of the puzzle. It was necessary to go beyond initial assumptions if we were to design solutions that addressed the problem holistically. To extend the scope of the research, I interviewed cognitive scientists, statisticians, HCI researchers, and scholars involved in algorithmic fairness to uncover insights about the challenges and limitations of "explaining AI”, and its implications for society at large.</p>

From underwriters to regulators and doctors working with machine learning algorithms to make predictions, end-users need to understand the justification behind the model decisions to be able to trust the system or to inform consequential actions.<p>
