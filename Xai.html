                 <p class="text1-new text-white">XaiPient’s mission is to make AI transparent and easy to understand by offering ways to inspect the “whys” behind AI systems’ decisions. A big problem of machine models today is that they are good at predicting certain outcomes with a high degree of accuracy, but fail at explaining how they arrive at those outcomes (a problem known as black-box). As more aspects of the world are automated by AI, knowing how AI models operate is crucial to prevent accidents and biases when these systems are deployed in the wild.<p>

                 <h2 class="title3-new">Approach</h2>
                 <p class="text2-new">We joined the founding team for four months to help them turn years of technical research into a tangible product. We helped the product team make sense of the fast-growing space of interpretability (XAI) by mapping out different competitors, investigating potential new technologies, and identifying relevant issues regarding the design of explanations in a wide range of applications, and for different users and domains. After gathering insights from users, we produced prototypes to validate hypotheses about the value proposition of certain features and aspects of the product.</p>

                 <h2 class="title3-new">Problem</h2>
                 <p class="text2-new">The biggest design challenge we faced was: how do we build human-friendly explanations that let users understand what influenced a machine decision without relying on technical concepts and complex data visualizations? Additionally, how do we communicate decisions effectively for different levels of literacy and use cases? Since the prediction made by a machine learning system is probabilistic, how do we communicate uncertainty without influencing user behavior? And finally, how do we prevent explanations from being misunderstood, potentially putting at risk those affected by these very systems?</p>

                 <h2 class="title3-new">Acheivements</h2>
                 <p class="text2-new">After validating different hypotheses and gaining insights about different use cases, we shifted our focus towards ideating on solutions. We prioritized thinking in components and design patterns rather than worrying about flows and secondary navigation aspects of the application. This decision enabled the team to make progress on the core components of the product before the strategy was fully defined. We worked with developers and designers to create a highly customizable pattern library comprising different explanation methods and visualizations that matched different levels of data literacy, goals and needs.</p>
