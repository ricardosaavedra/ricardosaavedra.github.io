                <p class="text2">Users liked how Wonder allowed them to simulate social experiences, and I wanted to double down on this insight. I began to look for inspiration in how people interact in social spaces such as conferences and bars. Social interactions tend to gravitate around sub-groups of 2/3 people, with many sub-conversations emerging when too many new participants join a small group.</p>
                
                <p class="text2">While being part of the whole, sub-conversations are intimate and personal. Sound leaks allow participants to gather context about topics and interests.</p>

                <p class="text2">Interactions in physical spaces are full of non-verbal cues that enable people to adapt better to social situations. It's possible to infer a lot of signals by looking at participants interacting in space. But interactions in virtual spaces are different. Instead, online interactions tend to be transactional and dull, contributing to the "zoom fatigue" effect.</p>
                
                <p class="text2">To tackle this problem, I sought ways to bring social cues to the space. I played with rules and algorithms to visualize people's behavior in the space to help participants to understand social dynamics visually. For example, the participant size was dictated by how much they spoke in a conversation. Similarly, I used other elements like the glow to visualize sound activity.</p>
                
                <p class="text2">User validation allowed me to confirm that users could create stories about people and how they interacted even before they joined a circle.

                <p class="text2">The original Wonder model had no physics dynamics, and the lack of simple affordances affected the participant's ability to quickly create a model of how Wonder worked.</p>
                <p class="text2">After experimenting with various models, I arrived at the magnet metaphor. In this model, participants were detached or connected to other magnets. Some participants (e.g., Hosts) could have a bigger force giving them special powers to perform some actions.</p>

                <p class="text2">I wanted to simplify the app work by creating a closer relationship between conversations and presentation modes. "Present to space" was a solution that allowed me to create a consistent spatial and consistent behavior.</p>

                    <p class="text2">Similar to the conversation view, presentations can be maximized while maintaining the participant's location in space. Spatial sound helps to create a much more immersive experience where attendees can quickly see who's on a call to increase the feeling of emotional connection with others.</p>

                <p class="text2">Instead of joining circles without prior context (old model), users could now feel and understand interactions before joining a group, which helped them to find the right participants or groups to join.</p>
                
                <p class="text2">Participants could also overhear conversations near them, which gave them more opportunities to start new conversations with people they didn't know. These changes increased average conversation time and reduced new participants' churn.</p>
                
                <p class="text2">From quantitative data, I concluded that the new conversation flow was 2x more engaging, enabling participants to have more focused conversations with fewer interruptions.</p>
                
                <p class="text2">The new format created a consistent experience between conversations and presentations, delivering a much more human and engaging UX when in full screen. Users mentioned the ability to feel closer to other attendees by being able to see all participants in a presentation.</p>
                
                <p class="text2">This new mode also allowed new gathering types on Wonder, unlocking many more use cases for the product.</p>
