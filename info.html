                <h3 class="bio">I’m a multidisciplinary interface and software designer currently exploring interfaces that extend/augment human cognition on various tasks (from music-making to scientific discovery) by combining data visualization techniques, machine learning, and interface design. Additionally, I’m working on making black-box machine learning models more transparent <a href="HCI-approach-to-XAI.html">(read more about it here)</a>. I believe that giving users the ability to better understand the underlying computational processes of AI systems to gain better control over their algorithms is one of the grand challenges of HCI research. A user-centered approach to AI design can help us understand AI/Interpretability problem spaces more intimately – opening up more imaginative zones for innovation, speculation, and design alternatives through which people and AI systems might become more closely aligned.</h3>

                <h3 class="bio">I’m currently working with <a>Creative Commons</a> founder <a>Lawrence Lessig</a> and other researchers at <a>Harvard Law School</a> and <a>Oxford</a> on designing a computational environment for governance in online communities <a>(read our whitepaper here)</a>. We’re currently working with <a>Seed</a>, a multiplayer online game development company to build a software prototype late in 2020.</h3>

                <h3 class="bio">In early 2019, I took part in a think-thank program, <a>Strelka</a>, where I explored projects on the intersection of AI, urbanism, and interface design. As an outcome, I developed <a>Sybl</a>, a software proposal aimed at making simulation environments easier to deploy and more open to a wider community of practitioners. Practical applications include AI research (AI Gym), autonomous vehicles research, digital twins and data science.</h3>

                <h3 class="bio">Previously, I worked on the Web3/crypto space (<a>Status.im</a>, <a>Pando</a>) exploring questions around distributed ownership, intellectual property, financial inclusion (Defi), and privacy (gossip-based protocols). I also researched <a>interface-based solutions</a> to tackle crypto-economic challenges in P2P networks.</h3>

                <h3 class="bio">Before relocating to Berlin, I spent 5 years living and working in the SF/Bay Area. At <a>Samsung Mobile Lab</a>, I led the development and design of various prototypes of mobile operating systems, new interface paradigms and wearables design (<a>Ikon</a>, <a>Gear Solo</a>, <a>Panzeis</a>). The group I led explored themes around human-augmentation, quantified-self, accessibility, and computer vision in the context of mobile computing. Following my work at Samsung, I went on to study computational design at <a>Mills College</a>, where I developed various interfaces for music expression: generative sound algorithms, sensors, and custom hardware. There, I also had the pleasure to work alongside electronic music pioneers <a>John Bischoff</a> and <a>Pauline Oliveros</a>.</h3>

                <h3 class="bio mt-5"><span>Want to work together?</span></h3>
                <h3 class="bio">I am currently freelancing.</h3>
                
                <h3 class="bio">I design and implement interfaces, explore design solutions and apply viable technical architectures to loosely defined problems. I'm interested in working on projects at the intersection of data visualization, AI/ML, machine learning interpretability, data science, and new interfaces for technical computational processes (e.g. new and easy-to-use programming languages).</h3>
