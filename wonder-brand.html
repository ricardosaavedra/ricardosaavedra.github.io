This shift in user habit pointed to the necessity for the product to reevaluate its original principles, opportunities, and focus.</p>

                        <p class="text2 bold">After observing this shift, I focused on developing a more comprehensive product narrative to serve as a new brand's foundation. Additionally, I led the development of the branding system and, later, the new design system and product redesign.</p>

                        <p class="text2 bold">The output of this exercise brought focus and confidence to the team to execute more effectively and plan the development of more complex project iterations. Wonder's brand and product narrative had a short-term impact by enabling the product to communicate its value to its core audience effectively. Internally, the new product narrative gave product teams clarity to focus on core user problems.</p>

                <p class="text2">After experiencing a hyper-growth phase, where the product grew exponentially across various use cases, Wonder lacked a clear direction for where to go next. Metrics such as retention and NPS were on a downward trajectory, and the influx of users that the team grew accustomed to stopped as quickly as lockdown measures loosened up.</p>

                <p class="text2">There were conflicting hypotheses explaining Wonder's decline across the organization with no decisive paths forward. Aside from never developing a robust visual system that matched the product's value proposition, a strong brand was only one of many problems that challenged the product.</p>

                    <p class="text2 bold">Gatherings, not video conferencing</p>
                    <p class="text2">For gatherings where the dissemination of content is the priority, tools like Zoom and Google Meet deliver the best presentation experience. But as we transition to a remote-first environment, social cues from co-workers and the ability to emotionally connect with attendees before and after a presentation are as important (if not more important) than the content. After all, going to a conference has more to do with the conversations and people you meet there rather than the content presented.</p>

                    <p class="text2">How often have you left an online event feeling worse than when you joined? Socializing online using tools that were not designed for social connection is hard. Async communication tools like Slack and online conferencing tools like Zoom will continue to have a space. Still, as we transition most of our interactions to online (work, social, study, etc.), we need more tools that bring the affordances from physical spaces to interactions online.</p>

                    <p class="text2">The future we're designing for is one where teams are distributed, but the need to be together in one shared space is still present. Whether to get together on Fridays or work together on a project, Wonder's core UX is simple, fun to use, open, and built for organic interactions.</p>

                    <p class="text2">We create online spaces where the content you share matters as much as the feeling of being present with others in the room. We create gatherings that make you leave energized.</p>

                <p class="text2">After synthesizing our learnings, I shifted my focus to designing execution. For this particular phase of the project, I worked with folks at Design Studio to help me execute and develop a brand identity. The manifesto I wrote worked as a guide to our visual explorations. From the core idea, we developed mood boards as the starting points for visual explorations. </p>

                <p class="text2">As we experimented with visual grammar and how they communicated Wonder's message, I was focused on finding a language that worked well in marking materials and the product UI.</p>

                    <p class="text2">Unlike our competitors, Wonder's design language needed to be organic and open to juxtapose the rigidity that most conferencing tools display. I wanted the final language that felt open to creativity without being prescriptive.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p class="text2">I used the output of these explorations to validate their resonance with the internal team and users to indicate points for improvement by building upon those early experiments to see how other product elements would stand. I was interested in UI, motion, typography, and illustration across the critical parts of the application.</p>

                <p class="text2">The initial experimentations clarified aspects worth keeping and other points that didn't add to our message. For example, the illustration style of the Bubbles concept looked different from humans. Additionally, the color scheme was sterile, lacking vibrancy. Other explorations had other minor aspects that were successful but, as a whole, needed to add to create cohesive systems.</p>
                
                <p class="text2">We settled on this final concept for a few reasons. The bubble concept paired with illustration was successful in communicating clearly what Wonder's message is. The vibrant color scheme gives the right flexibility to create the right tone of voice. The final type combination integrated a humanistic aspect I wanted to bring with a San Serif font with minor elements that added to the playful and organic message.</p>
